NAME
    methods - Provide method syntax and autoclean namespaces

SYNOPSIS
        use methods;

        # with signature
        method foo($bar, %opts) {
           $self->bar(reverse $bar) if $opts{rev};
        }

        # attributes
        method foo : lvalue { $self->{foo} }

        # change invocant name
        method foo ($class: $bar) { $class->bar($bar) }

        # "1;" no longer required here

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses Method::Signatures::Simple to provide named and
    anonymous methods with parameters, except with a shorter module name.

    It also imports namespace::autoclean so the "method" helper function (as
    well as any imported helper functions) won't become methods in the
    importing module.

    Finally, it also imports true so there's no need to put "1;" in the end
    of the importing module.
